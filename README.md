# Men-and-Women-Income-Difference

The topic is: Is there a significant difference in income between men and women? Does the difference vary depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.)?

I did data pre-processing first, and then I used box plots, bar charts to study the income difference by race, region, grade, education level, marital status, family size. After that, I used regression model to study which variables will have significant impact on the income gap between men and women. Finally, I created regression diagnostic plots to study whether the linear model is appropriate.
